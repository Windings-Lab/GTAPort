Windows Defender Exclusions
----
DISABLE Anti-virus and Windows Defender from performing real-time scans on source directories.

If you fail to do this, every time you switch branches (which can affect 10000s of files in UE), it will re-scan for viruses. Itâ€™s an insane waste of time. Just turn it off.

Corollary: Keep viruses out of your source directories. :P
